Business Data Pipeline
This project demonstrates a modular Python-based ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline designed to process e-commerce sales data. It extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it using Pandas, and loads the cleaned data into an SQLite database for further analysis and reporting. Additionally, it includes data visualization components to help you analyze sales trends and distributions.

Features
Extract: Load e-commerce sales data from a CSV file.

Transform: Clean and format the data (e.g., round amounts, convert dates).

Load: Load the cleaned data into an SQLite database for reporting.

Modular Design: The ETL pipeline is divided into modular components to ensure flexibility and maintainability.

Error Handling: Each stage in the pipeline has robust error handling to ensure smooth execution.

Data Visualization: Generate sales-related visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

How to Run the ETL Pipeline
1. Prepare Data
Ensure you have a sample_sales.csv file in the data/ directory. The file should have the following columns:

id (unique transaction ID)

amount (transaction amount)

date (transaction date in YYYY-MM-DD format)

2. Execute the Pipeline
To run the ETL pipeline, execute the main.py script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python main.py
This will:

Extract data from sample_sales.csv.

Transform the data (round amounts and convert dates).

Load the transformed data into a SQLite database named sales.db.

3. Data Visualization
After loading the data into the database, you can use the visualization.py script to generate visualizations such as:

Sales Trends Over Time (line graph)

Sales Distribution (histogram)

Total Sales Per Day (bar chart)

To generate these visualizations, run:

bash
Copy
Edit
python visualization.py
